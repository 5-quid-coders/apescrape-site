## Workflows

Workflows represent your webscraping setups, they store combinations of Criteria and Datasources. From here you can see all of the times that webscraping process was run and see the results it produced. 

You can control how long previous workflow 'runs' are kept by specifying a data retention period. 

You can download workflow results to store them outside of apescrape.
