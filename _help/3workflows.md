# Workflows
Workflows represent your web scraping set up, consisting of two key components: [**Criteria**](./2criteria) and [**Data Sources**](./3datasource). 

**Criteria** indicate the type of data you want to collect and **Data Sources** are a list of all the websites you want to collect data from. 

Workflows can be run as many times as you like to ensure you always have up to date information, and can also be paused to ensure data is only collected when you want it to. You can also view the time that each Workflow run was started, so you know when your data was collected. 

Workflows can also be edited to allow you to change your mind after setup!

Finally, data collected during a Workflow can be exported as an Excel (.xlsx) file, allowing you to analyse your data in the most comfortable way for you. More information on Exporting is available [here.](./5exporting)
