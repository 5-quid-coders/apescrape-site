## Workflows
Workflows represent your web scraping set up, consisting of two key components: **Criteria** and **Data Sources**. 

**Criteria** indicate the type of data you want collected and **Data Sources** are a stored list of all the URLs of the websites you want to collect from. 

Workflows can be re-run and paused to make sure the data you need is ready when you are.You can also see all the times that your workflows were run each run’s resulting data, making trend analysis a breeze. 

Workflow settings allow you to control how long each Workflow’s data is stored, keeping your workspace clean and current. Each Workflow’s data is exportable to various spreadsheet formats including Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice and CSV — making the Workflows seamlessly fit into your daily… workflow!
