# Teams

## What are Teams?
In ApeScrape, a **'Team'** is a group of people who can view, create, edit, and run the name Workflows, Criteria and Data Sources.

## Team Roles
A Team is formed of two roles:
- **Admin**: An Admin can change the roles of other members of a Team, and remove Team members
- **Member**: A member cannot change the roles of other members of a Team

## Create a New Team
To **create a new Team**, navigate to the 'Teams' page. This can be done by clicking the 'Teams' button on the sidebar or by clicking on [this link](https://dashboard.apescrape.com/teams/)

Next click the button labelled 'New Team' and input a name for your new Team.

Finally, click the button labelled 'Create'.

Well done! You have created a new Team.

## Invite New Team Members
You can also **invite new Team members** to your Team so you can collaborate together. 

To do this, go to the ['Teams page'](https://dashboard.apescrape.com/teams/) and press the 'Select' button next to the Team you wish to invite a new member to. 

At the top left of this page, there is an input box with a button next to it labelled 'Invite'. Type the Email Address of the person you wish to invite, then click 'Invite' and an Email will be sent to this person inviting them to join your Team.

# Remove Team Members
If you wish to **remove a member from a Team**, go to the ['Teams page'](https://dashboard.apescrape.com/teams/) and press the 'Select' button next to the Team you wish to remove a member from. 

On this page, find the Email Address of the person you wish to remove, and click the button labelled 'Remove' to the right of this persons Email.

This person will then be removed from the Team and will no longer be able to access the Criteria, Workflows or Data Sources created by this Team.

## Delete a Team
If you wish to delete a Team, go to the ['Teams page'](https://dashboard.apescrape.com/teams/) and press the 'Select' button next to the Team you wish to delete.

At the top of this page, there is a red button labelled 'Delete'. Click this to delete the Team.

ApeScrape will then confirm that you wish to delete the selected Team. Click 'Ok' to Confirm.

**Warning**  
**Once you delete a Team, it cannot be reversed and all Workflows, Criteria and Data Sources created will be permanently deleted, along with any data ApeScrape has collected.**
