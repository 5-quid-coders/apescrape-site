## Datasources

Datasources store domains you would like your workflow to target.

Datasources store a collection of website Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and names, you can add as many as you need. Normally you will want to create a workflow that stores a collection of websites within a theme, such as websites belonging to restaurants in Edinburgh.

*You don't need to include the URL of every page you want to scrape*, Apescrape will find those automatically.

You're free to use the same datasource for multiple workflows, even if they use different criteria.
