# Criteria

The **Criteria** is one of the components that make up a **Workflow**. It specifies exactly what data you want to be collected from web pages. 

A Criteria has two parts:

- **Page Validators**
- **Fields**


## Page Validators
The **Page Validator** is an English description that tells your Workflow whether a page it encounters is relevant to your search.


## Fields

Each **Field** of a Criteria describes the specific type of information you want to extract from web pages. It consists of a **Name** and **Description**. 

The **Name** of a field is how this field will be referred to when data is collected.

The **Description** is a simple one-sentence English explanation of what data your Workflow should search for.

Some fields can optionally be marked as **Unique Identifiers"**. This is used to combine duplicated data. For example, if I had a field called "name", and I marked it as a unique identifier, then any data which had the same value for the name field and doesn't have any other conflicts will be merged. An important note is that if you add any unique identifiers, any data that does not populate at least one unique identifier will be discarded.

> **Helpful Tip**  
> When creating your Fields, think of a spreadsheet containing the data output. The **Name** part of the Field will be the column header, and the **Description** will be the type of data that would populate that column.


## Now Let's Put It All Together

### Scenario:
Looking for information about **restaurants in Edinburgh** from a set of tourist websites.

### Page Validator:
**Restaurant in Edinburgh**

> Now letâ€™s say you are looking for the names of the restaurant and their descriptions:

### Fields:

- **Name:**  
  Restaurant name  
  **Description:**  
  What is this restaurant called?

- **Name:**  
  Restaurant type  
  **Description:**  
  What is a one-sentence summary of this restaurant?


## How to Make the Most of Your Criteria

- Be **specific** in the Field Descriptions to avoid confusion between similar data points.
- It is best practice to look at some of the websites you want to collect data from to get familiar with how to best phrase your Descriptions.

> **Helpful Tip**  
> Once your Criteria is created, you can reuse it when making new Workflows. This saves time if you want to collect the same types of information from different websites.
