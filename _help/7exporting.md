# Exporting Your Data

ApeScrape includes a function to allow you to **export** your data as an Excel (.xlsx) file. To do this, navigate to the Workflow Run View page, where you are able to see all the data ApeScrape has found for you. 

From here, press the button labeled **'Export Data'**, and click **'New Export'**. This is shown in the image below:

From here, an Excel file will begin compiling with your collected data. This may take some time depending on the amount of data you have collected. But don't worry, ApeScrape will send you a handy email when your data is ready to download!

From here, just press the Export button again, and this time click on the specific Export you want to download.
